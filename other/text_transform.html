				It is a long established fact that a reader will be distracted by the readable content of a page when looking at
				its layout. The
				<span class="capitalize"> point of using Lorem Ipsum is that it has a more-or-less normal</span>
				<span class="lowercase">
					distribution of letters, as opposed to using 'Content here, content here', making it look like readable
					English. Many desktop publishing packages and web page editors now use Lorem Ipsum as their default model
					text, and a search for 'lorem ipsum' will uncover many web sites still in their infancy. Various versions have
					evolved over the years, sometimes by accident, sometimes on purpose (injected humour and the like).
